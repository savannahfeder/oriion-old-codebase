# Oriion âœ¨
Oriion is an accountability chrome extension developed to reduce the extremely low engagement and retention rates of self-paced online courses.

### The Stats
- Massively open online courses (MOOCs) are a rapidly growing $8 billion market 
- MOOCs are, in theory, a great solution to combatting the increasing inaccessibility of education (already sky-high tuitions increasing at twice the rate of inflation)
- But in practice, [only 4% of students enrolled actually complete them](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330316898_The_MOOC_pivot), and the average student [does not make it more than 1/3 of the way through](https://might-could.com/essays/online-classes-dont-work/#:~:text=Udemy%20reports%20that%20the%20average,never%20even%20start%20the%20course!) before giving up.

### The Causes
We sent out a survey to look at the reasons behind these low completion rates, and the following are the three most commonly reported culprits:
- **70%** of respondents responded "**the course did not take priority over other things on my to-do list"** as their either one or two top reasons for not progressing further in an online course
- **50%** of respondents responded "**I lost motivation to progress further through the course"** as their top one or two reason for not progressing further in an online course
- **31.3%** checked off **"I felt isolated taking the course on my own"** as a reason why they have not completed or progressed very far in an online course

### The solution?
A platform that incentivizes students to prioritize their online course, while maintaining their motivation, and keeping them accountable and not isolated.

After reading (okay, skimming) a handful of articles, books and studies on motivation, education and accountability, I came up with a few easy-to-implement features, and mapped them on a value-complexity graph to determine the features of the MVP.

The four features in the top left high value, low complexity quadrant came together nicely to fit a theme of an **online course accountability tracker**. And that is what the MVP was to be. More updates to come once that's been deployed to the Chrome Web Store ðŸš€
